NEXTA 2018 - 1st IEEE Workshop on NEXt level of Test Automation
http://www.testomatproject.eu/nexta2018

April, 2018, Västerås, Sweden
Co-located with IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification
and Validation (ICST 2018)


+++ Important Dates +++

Submission: January 12, 2018
Notification: February 19, 2018
Camera ready: February 28, 2018
Workshop: April 9, 2018


+++ Theme and Goals +++

Test automation has been an acknowledged software engineering best practice
for years. However, the topic involves more than the repeated execution of test
cases that often comes first to mind. Simply running test cases using a unit
testing framework is no longer enough for test automation to keep up with the
ever-shorter release cycles driven by continuous deployment and technological
innovations such as micro-services and DevOps pipelines.

Now test automation needs to rise to the next level by going beyond mere test
execution. The NEXTA workshop will explore how to advance test automation to
further contribute to software quality in the context of tomorrow's rapid
release cycles. Take-aways for industry practitioners and academic researchers
will encompass test case generation, automated test result analysis, test suite
assessment and maintenance, and infrastructure for the future of test
automation.


+++ Topics of Interest +++

NEXTA solicits contributions targeting all aspects of test automation, from
initial test design to automated verdict analysis. Topics of interest include,
but are not limited to, the following:

 + Test execution automation
 + Test case generation
 + Automatic test design generation
 + Analytics, learning and big data in relation to test automation
 + Automatic aspects management in test, progress, reporting, planning etc.
 + Visualization of test
 + Evolution of test automation
 + Test suite architecture and infrastructure
 + Test environment, simulation, and other contextual issues for automated
   testing
 + Test tools, frameworks, and general support for test automation
 + Testing in an agile and continuous integration context, and testing within
   DevOps
 + Orchestration of test
 + Metrics, benchmarks, and estimation on any type of test automation
 + Any type of test technologies relying on automation of test
 + Process improvements and assessments related to test automation
 + Test automation maturity and experience reports on test automation
 + Automatic retrieval of test data and test preparation aspect
 + Maintainability, monitoring and refactoring of automated test suites
 + Training and education on automated testing
 + Automated test for product lines and high-variability systems
 + Test automation patterns
 + Automated test oracles



+++ Submission and Proceedings +++

NEXTA solicits the following types of original papers:
 + Technical Papers (max. 8 pages in IEEE format). Full papers presenting
   research results or industrial practices related to the next generation of
   test automation.
 + Position and Experience Papers (max. 4 pages in IEEE format). Short papers
   introducing challenges, visions, positions or preliminary results within the
   scope of the workshop. Experience reports and papers on open challenges in
   industry are especially welcome.
 + Tool Papers (max. 4 pages in IEEE format). Tool papers introduce tools that
   implement an approach to support the transition to the next generation of
   test automation. A tool paper submission must include either 1) a URL to a
   screencast of the tool in action, or 2) a runnable version of the tool for
   evaluation by the program committee.
 + Abstracts with Video submission (Not exceeding more than 8 minutes) -
   These videos will be shown separate - and will not be included in the
   publications, but as a parallel source of information. The video submission
   must be linked and visible on open source tools, and can include a
   presentation, demo or experience on test automation.

Authors should submit a PDF version of their paper through the NEXTA 2018
paper submission site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nexta2018.
All accepted papers will be part of the ICST joint workshop proceedings
published in the IEEE Digital Library.
